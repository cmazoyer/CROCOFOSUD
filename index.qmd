title: "TRAINING CROCO (PSF 2024 IRD)"
---

The aim of the CROCOFOSUD 2024 school is to learn how to use the CROCO 3D ocean code (<https://www.croco-ocean.org/>). It is aimed at people with an oceanography background who are either beginners or who wish to reinforce their knowledge of the general concepts of CROCO. 

During the PSF CROCOFOSUD project, we organized training sessions every year for three years in Barcelonnette, in the Alps, France. The last training session took place from November 18 to 22, 2024.


<!--The course will take place from Monday, the 18th to Friday, the 22nd of November 2024 in Barcelonnette in the Alps, France. We recommend that you arrive the day before, on November 17th. For more information on the location, click on the [How to go](transport.qmd) tab.-->
